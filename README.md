# Project scenario
You're a data analyst at a marketing firm that promotes brands on social media. Your team wants you to use Python to extract tweets based on specific categories (health, family, food, etc.), clean and analyze the data, and create visualizations. They will use your analysis to help clients improve their social media performance. This insight will allow the firm to deliver tweets on time and within budget, leading to faster results.

# Summary
With Python's Pandas, NumPy, and visualisation tools like Seaborn, I have employed sophisticated data manipulation and analysis techniques that could lead to an optimised content strategy.

# Solution
This project's success is based on its ability to provide actionable insights for content creators and strategists via a combination of data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques. The proposed solution not only meets the stated objectives, but it also provides tangible benefits to businesses, enabling them to make informed decisions, optimize content strategies, and increase audience engagement for greater overall success. 

# Approach
In this project, I employed a systematic approach leveraging Pandas and NumPy for data generation, exploration, and cleaning. Through the thoughtful use of Pandas functions, missing values were addressed, data types were optimized, and duplicates were removed to ensure a reliable dataset. Visualization tools like Seaborn were employed to create a histogram and boxplot, providing clear insights into the distribution of likes across categories.
